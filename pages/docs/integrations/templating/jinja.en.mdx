# Jinja Templating

AIOP allows each user to generate files from a [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) template. It is also possible to generate templated PDFs (learn more [here](/docs/integrations/pdf#le-markdown-templatis%C3%A9)).

Jinja is a fast, expressive, and extensible template engine. It allows fields to write code similar to Python syntax.

## Usage

Jinja is simple to use. Let's look at some ways to use it. Here is a guide to help you get started:

<Steps>
### 1. Create a Jinja Template

A Jinja template is essentially a text file with special tags that will be replaced by dynamic values. For example, suppose you have a file `template.txt` with the following content:

```jinja  filename="template.txt"
Hello {{ name }},

Thank you for your order of {{ product }}. Your order will be shipped to the following address:
{{ address }}.

Regards,
The Sales Team
```

### 2. Declare the Template

Next, declare the template in your playbook as follows:

```yaml
- source: template.txt
  destination: file.txt
  template: jinja
  compatibility:
    - system:
      template_data:
        name: My name
        product: My product
        address: My address
```

The result after generating the package:

```txt  filename="file.txt"
Hello My name,

Thank you for your order of My product. Your order will be shipped to the following address:
My address.

Regards,
The Sales Team
```

### 3. Use Control Structures

Jinja allows the use of control structures such as loops and conditions to generate more complex dynamic content. For example:

```jinja filename="template.txt"
Hello {{ name }},

Thank you for your order of {{ product }}. Your order contains the following items:

{% for item in items %}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

Your order will be shipped to the following address:
{{ address }}.

Regards,
The Sales Team
```

### 4. Declare the Template

And in the declaration:

```yaml
- source: template.txt
  destination: file.txt
  template: jinja
  compatibility:
    - system:
      template_data:
        name: My name
        product: My product
        items: [Item1, Item2]
        address: My address
```

The result after generating the package:

```txt filename="file.txt"
Hello My name,

Thank you for your order of My product. Your order contains the following items:

- Item1
- Item2

Your order will be shipped to the following address:
My address.

Regards,
The Sales Team
```

</Steps>
