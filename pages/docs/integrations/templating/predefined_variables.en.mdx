# Available Variables

AIOP offers predefined variables that can be used in your file templates. These data are stored in Python dictionaries:

```Python
template_data = {
    "system_target": {
      "name": "System",
      "args": {
          "function": ["function1"]
      },
    },
    "system_inventory": {
      "name": "System",
      "args": {
          "function": ["function1", "function2"]
      },
    },
    "my_variable": "Variable value"
}
```

## System Variables

The system variables provided by AIOP include data from the system target and the playbook inventory. Let's break down the system variables:

- `system_target`: Stores data of the system target
  - `name`: Name of the system target
  - `args`: Dictionary containing the desired elements with the target. This is defined by the user passed as an argument during the `aiop build` command
    - `function`: In this case, the user requested a package with the `function1` function.
- `system_inventory`: Stores data of the inventory related to the system target
  - `name`: Name of the target in the inventory (redundant with `system_target`)
  - `args`: Dictionary containing the elements compatible with the desired system target in the inventory.
    - `function`: In this case, the functions compatible with the desired system target are `["function1", "function2"]`.

## Custom Variables

Custom variables that can be used in the template are specifically declared for a target in the resource declaration. Here is an example:

```yaml {3,6-7}
- source: template.md
  destination: generated.md
  template: jinja
  compatibility:
    - system:
      template_data:
        my_variable: Variable value
```

The variable `my_variable` is defined in the resource declaration `template.md` under the `template_data` field. During file generation, the `my_variable` variable will be available.
