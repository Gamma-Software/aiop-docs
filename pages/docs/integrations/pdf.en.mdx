# PDF Generation

AIOP allows you to generate PDFs from HTML or Markdown.

## From Markdown

AIOP uses the tool [mdpdf](https://github.com/elliotblackburn/mdpdf/tree/master) for generating a PDF from a Markdown file.

Generating a PDF from Markdown is the simplest way, as you only need to know the basics of Markdown. However, the format of the document will not be customizable (see generation from [HTML](#from-html)).

Here is an example of a PDF generated from Markdown:
![pdf](./img/pdf.png)

### Markdown Syntax

To learn how to write in Markdown, you can consult [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Let's take the example of the PDF file generated above. The content of this Markdown is as follows:

```markdown
# Markdown Tutorial

Welcome to this Markdown tutorial! This guide will show you the basics and some advanced features of Markdown.

## Headings

You can create headings using the `#` symbol:

`markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
`

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

### Declaration

AIOP generates a PDF file from a Markdown file if you declare a resource with a source extension `.md` (Markdown) and a destination extension `pdf` (PDF). Here is an example of a resource declaration.

```yaml
- source: mymarkdown.md
  destination: mypdf.pdf
```

After the package generation, the file `mypdf.pdf` will be created in the root folder of the package.

## From HTML

To generate a PDF from HTML, AIOP uses the tool [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.org/). This allows you to create advanced PDFs with CSS and custom fonts.

Here is an example of a PDF generated from HTML:
![html](./img/html.png)

### HTML and CSS Syntax

You need to know the basics of HTML and CSS to generate PDFs from HTML. However, there are examples of PDFs already available [here](https://github.com/CourtBouillon/weasyprint-samples/).

### Declaration

AIOP generates a PDF file from a resource with a source extension `.html` (HTML) or a folder containing an `.html` file and a destination extension `.pdf` (PDF). Here is an example of a resource declaration.

The playbook content is as follows:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".git">
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".aiop" />
    <FileTree.File name="invoice.aml" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="invoice" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="invoice.html" />
        <FileTree.File name="invoice.css" />
        <FileTree.File name="pacifico.ttf" />
        <FileTree.File name="sourcesanspro-bold.otf" />
        <FileTree.File name="sourcesanspro-regular.otf" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The declaration is as follows:

```yaml filename="invoice.aml"
- source: invoice/invoice.html
  destination: invoice.pdf
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In this case, only the `.html` file is declared. This means that the HTML format will be basic and the fonts will be system fonts.
</Callout>

It is possible to generate a PDF from a folder containing HTML and CSS files. Here is an example of a resource declaration. If the HTML and CSS files are in the folder, AIOP will return an error.

```yaml filename="invoice.aml"
- source: invoice/
  destination: invoice_folder.pdf
```

It is also possible to generate a PDF from a list of files including an HTML file and a CSS file. Here is an example of resource declaration.

```yaml filename="invoice.aml"
- source: invoice/invoice.html & invoice/invoice.css & invoice/pacifico.ttf & invoice/sourcesanspro-bold.otf & invoice/sourcesanspro-regular.otf
  destination: invoice_merged.pdf
```
