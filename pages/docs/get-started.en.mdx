# Getting Started

This quick introduction helps you start using Aiop quickly. Feel free to check out the [demo video](/docs/demo) that covers the elements of this page.

You can install Aiop in a local Python environment or with Docker. For a local installation, follow the instructions below. For installation with Docker, refer to this [section](/docs/get-started#docker).

## Prerequisites

### Python

A Python 3.9+ environment is required to use Aiop. If you don't have Python installed, you can download the following versions, depending on your operating system:

  />
</Cards>

The Python installation guide on Windows can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer).

</Tab>
<Tab>
{/* Ubuntu */}

<Steps>

### Installing Python

Install the recommended version of Python 3.11.8 using your package manager. Update your package manager and install necessary dependencies. Then add the deadsnakes repository to install Python versions.

```bash copy
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

Then install the Python version of your choice. Please install versions higher than 3.11. We recommend installing version 3.11.8.

```bash copy
sudo apt install python3.11
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can, however, install the latest version 3.12. However, we do not guarantee that Aiop will work.
</Callout>

Check the installed Python version with the command `python3 --version`.

### Installing Dependencies

Additionally, install development tools and libraries for Python that Aiop will use.

```bash copy
sudo apt-get install curl iputils-ping -y
```

### Installing Pip
If you don't have pip installed, you can install it with the following command:

```bash copy
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
```
</Steps>

### Aliases

To simplify the use of Python, it is recommended to create shortcuts for the `python` and `pip` commands to `python3` and `pip3` respectively:

```bash copy
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip
```

### Code Editor

A code editor is also required to work with Aiop. You can use any code editor you prefer. However, we recommend using Visual Studio Code. We have specially designed shortcuts for VSCode. In the future, we will develop [extensions](/roadmap) for VSCode.

You can download Visual Studio Code by clicking the button below.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Create an Aiop Account (Optional)

Start by creating an Aiop account. If you don't have an account, click the button below to create one.



### Install Aiop
Installing Aiop is simple. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash copy
pip install aiop --index-url https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/52727704/packages/pypi/simple
```

This will install Aiop and all its dependencies.


### Download a Playbook Template

To use Aiop, you need a [playbook](/docs/vocabulary#playbook). You can install a demo playbook template by running the following command:

```bash copy
aiop demo ./my-demo-playbook
```

This will download the playbook template into the `my-playbook` folder.

### Generate Your First Package

You're finally there! You can now generate your first package by running the following command:

```bash copy
cd my-playbook
aiop build archi1/model_range1/model1 --apps app1 --envs dev --contexts context1
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="✅">
  Done, you've just generated your first package !
</Callout>

You can now see the generated package in the `.build` folder at the root of the playbook.

</Steps>

## Docker

If you prefer to use Docker, you can install it by following the instructions below.

<Steps>

### Install Docker

Install Docker on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Download the Docker image

Download the aiop Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/aiop/aiop:latest
```

For a specific version, replace `latest` with the desired version.

```bash
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/aiop/aiop:0.3.1
```

For a development version:

```bash
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/aiop/aiop/dev:latest
```

### (Recommended / Optional) Rename the image

To simplify the use of the Docker image, you can rename the image by running the following command:

```bash
docker tag registry.gitlab.com/aiop/aiop:latest aiop
```

### Run aiop

To run aiop, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -it registry.gitlab.com/aiop/aiop:latest
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `-it` option is used to run the container in interactive mode and allocate a pseudo-TTY.
</Callout>

Or, if you have renamed the image:

```bash
docker run aiop
```

### Generate your first package

You can now generate your first package by running the following command:

```bash
docker run -v {local_playbook}:/playbook -v {path_to_aiop.yml}:/config/aiop.yml build {build_args}
```

You'll notice 3 arguments:

- `-v {local_playbook}:/playbook`: local_playbook is the path to your playbook on your local machine.
- `-v {path_to_aiop.yml}:/config/aiop.yml`: path_to_aiop.yml is the path to your aiop.yml file on your local machine.
- `build {build_args}`: build_args are the package build arguments.

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Now it's time to modify the playbook and make it your own. Move on to the [configuration](/docs/configurations/user) section to learn how to configure your playbook. Alternatively, you can watch an introductory video on Aiop [here](/demo).
