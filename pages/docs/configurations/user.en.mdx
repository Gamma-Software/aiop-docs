# User Configuration

AIOP allows the user to customize the application's behavior by modifying the configuration file. The configuration file is located in the user's directory:
- Unix: `~/.aiop/config.yaml`
- Windows: `%HOME%\.aiop\config.yaml`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Upon AIOP installation, a default configuration file is created. It can be [modified](#personalization) to customize the application's behavior.
</Callout>

The configuration file is in YAML format. It can be edited using a text editor or a code editor. It will then be read and validated by AIOP to customize its behavior.

## Configuration File Structure

Here's the structure of the configuration file. It includes parameters that allow customizing the application's behavior, as well as settings for logs, remote repositories, and license information.

Remote repositories require authentication to download remote resources. If any of the playbooks you are working on require a connection to a remote repository, you are required to add the login information in the `repositories` section.

The license is used for AIOP authentication. If you have a license, you need to add the corresponding information in the `license` section.

In case a plugin requires specific configuration, it should be integrated into the `plugin_config` section. Please refer to the plugin documentation or contact support via [support@aiop.io] for more information.

```yaml filename="~/.aiop/config.yaml"
build_timeout: {numeric value}
check_update: {true|false}
default_package_path: {absolute or relative path to playbook root}
download_retries: {numeric value}
plugin_config: {specific plugin configuration dictionary}
fmpp_bin_filepath: {path to FMPP binary}
logs:
  stdout: {CRITICAL|FATAL|ERROR|WARNING|WARN|INFO|DEBUG|NOTSET|DISABLED}
  file: {CRITICAL|FATAL|ERROR|WARNING|WARN|INFO|DEBUG|NOTSET|DISABLED}
repositories:
  - instance: {instance name}
    username: {username}
    password: {password}
    auth_type: {basic|api_key}
license:
  key: {license key}
  username: {username}
  password: {password}
  api_token: {API token}
```
