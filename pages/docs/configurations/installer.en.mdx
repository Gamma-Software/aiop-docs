# Configuring the Installer

In the `.aiop` folder of your playbook, you can configure the installers you want to generate. These folders are only used when you want to generate an installer with the command `aiop build --installer deb` [[Learn more](/docs/cli/build#commande-build_installer)].

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Installer configuration is optional and should, in most cases, allow you to generate an installer without complexity. This page is intended for those who want to customize the generation of installers.
</Callout>

## Configuration

In the playbook configuration file `.aiop`, add the `installer` field. Under `installer`, add the type of installer and its following sub-arguments.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Currently, installer generation is limited to `deb`. However, other types such as `exe` and `rpm` are under development.
</Callout>

- `name`: Name of the installer.
- `config_folder`: Installer configuration folder relative to the root of the playbook. This folder contains the configuration files for the installer generator. By default, they will be retrieved in the `installer/` folder.
- `source_path`: Absolute path of the package source files where they will be installed on the host machine. By default, they will be placed in `/usr/share/mysrc`.
- `bin_path`: Absolute path of the package binaries where they will be installed on the host machine. These binaries will be stored in the `source_path` folder and symlinked in `bin_path`. By default, they will be placed in `/usr/bin`.

An example configuration for a deb-type installer:

```yaml filename=".aiop"
playbook:
  installer:
    deb:
      name: installer-deb
      config_folder: installer/deb
      source_path: /usr/share/mysrc
      bin_path: /usr/bin
```

### Configuration of the `deb` Installer

Using the previous example, we can see that the configuration files are placed in the `installer/deb` folder.

Place the specific configuration files for this installer in this sub-folder:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
    <FileTree.Folder name="installer" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="deb" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="control" />
        <FileTree.File name="postinst" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

To customize the configuration of a `deb` installer for Debian Linux machines, you can create all the configuration files related to the `deb` installer in the `deb` folder within the `installer` folder.

For example, we want to modify the `control` configuration file to add a dependency on the `python` package.

```ansi filename="installer/deb/control"
Package: ${package_name}
Priority: extra
Maintainer: Valentin Rudloff <valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com>
Version: ${version}
Homepage: https://aiop.io
Architecture: all
Depends: python
Description: This is my description
```

You will notice that we have added the line `Depends: python` to add a dependency on the `python` package.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You do not need to put the package name and version in the `control` file; AIOP will replace the `${package_name}` and `${version}` variables in this file with those of the package. The version corresponds to the tag on your git repo.
</Callout>

We could go further and add a post-installation script in the `postinst` file:

```bash filename="installer/deb/postinst"
#!/bin/bash
echo "I am executed after the package installation"
```

In this script, we simply display a message in the console after the package installation.
