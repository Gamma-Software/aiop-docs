# Packages Configuration File

The packages configuration file is an optional file that allows you to configure all the packages you want to generate. It is used __exclusively__ by the `aiop build_all` command to generate all packages at once [[Learn more](/docs/cli/build#build_all-command)].

## Configuration

The packages configuration file is located in the playbook-relative directory:
- Unix: `<playbook_root>/.aiop/packages.yaml`
- Windows: `<playbook_root>\.aiop\packages.yaml`

> `<playbook_root>` is the root directory of the playbook.

Here's an example of a packages configuration file:

```yaml filename=".aiop/packages.yaml"
packages:
  - target_system: archi1/model_range1/model1
    compat_arg: [arg1]
    destination_path: .build_test
  - target_system: archi1/model_range1/model2
    compat_arg: [arg1]
    destination_path: .build_test2
```

Here, we want to generate two packages with different targets for the same arguments.

## File Configuration Structure

List the arguments of your packages in the `packages` field. If we refer back to the example above:

- `packages` is a list of packages to generate. Each package must have the following fields:
- `target_system` is the target system of the package.
- `compat_arg` is a list of package build arguments.
- `destination_path` is the relative path of the package's destination directory.

You'll notice that the arguments are the same as those of the `aiop build` command [[Learn more](/docs/cli/build#build-command)]. Indeed, you can use the same arguments to generate a package with the `aiop build` command or with the packages configuration file.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

The key points to consider in the packages configuration file are as follows:

- The following arguments are not allowed in the packages configuration file: [`verbose`, `sll`, `stdout_log_level`, `fll`, `file_log_level`, `hp`, `hide_progress`]
- Console logs for package generation are disabled by default. However, logs are still written to log files.
- By default, package generation will be forced and will overwrite previously generated packages. This means that the `force` option is enabled by default.
- Do not use the same destination path for multiple packages. This could overwrite a package being generated.
