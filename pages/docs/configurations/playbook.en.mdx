# Playbook Configuration

The playbook can be configured to meet your needs. The configuration file is located in the playbook's root directory:
- Unix: `<playbook_root>/.aiop` in the `playbook` field
- Windows: `<playbook_root>\.aiop` in the `playbook` field

> `<playbook_root>` is the root directory of the playbook.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Plugins can also provide additional configuration options. Please refer to the plugin documentation for more information. [Contact](mailto:support@aiop.io) technical support for any questions.
</Callout>

The configuration file is in YAML format. It can be edited with a text editor or code editor. It will then be read and verified by AIOP to customize the playbook.

## Configuration File Structure

This configuration file is specific to your playbook. It contains information about plugins, remote repositories, custom validation rules, post-build scripts, and other customization options that may come from plugins.

```yaml filename=".aiop"
playbook:
  playbook_name: {playbook_name}
  plugins:
    - name: {plugin_name}
      version: {plugin_version}
  repositories:
    - name: {repository_name}
      instance: {instance_name}
      type: {repository_type}
      base_url: {repository_base_url}
      repository_regex: {repository_regex}
  lint_rules:
    - classname: {rule_classname}
      path: {rule_script_path}
  post_scripts:
    - classname: {script_classname}
      path: {script_path}
```

## Customization

To customize, simply open and modify the configuration file.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** | **Possible Values** |

| [`playbook.post_scripts.path`](#lint_rules-and-post_scripts) | `str` | Relative path to the script. | |

All these fields are optional.

### `playbook_name`

The `playbook_name` section is the name of the playbook. By default, this will be the name of the playbook folder.

### `plugins`

The `plugins` section is a list of plugins to use for the playbook. Each plugin must have a name and a version. You can have as many plugins as you like.

### `repositories`

The `repositories` section is a list of remote repositories to use for the playbook. You are not limited in the number of repositories. Each repository must have a name, an instance, a type, a base URL, and a regex. Here is an explanation of each field:

- **`name`:** The name of the repository. This name is used to identify the repository in declarations.

- **`instance`:** The instance name corresponds to the parameter in the [user configuration file](/docs/configurations/user). It is the instance of a remote repository that the playbook will use.

- **`type`:** The type can currently be `artifactory` or `nexus`.

- **`base_url`:** The base URL of the repository. For example, for an Artifactory repository, the base URL is `https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/`.

- **`repository_regex`:** A regular expression to both validate that the path to the remote resource is correct and obtain additional data for processing during generation. For example, you might need to retrieve the version of the resource and its name and check that it is a Java application `.jar`. In this case, you can use a regex to extract this information: `(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar`. You can then retrieve the `version` and `name` values during package generation to use in your [`post_scripts`](#lint_rules-and-post_scripts).

### `lint_rules` and `post_scripts`

The `lint_rules` and `post_scripts` sections are lists of rules to execute at package generation time. Each rule must specify the class name and the relative path from the project root to the script file.

## Configuration Example

This configuration file can be challenging to set up, which is why we have created a sample inventory to help you get started. By default, AIOP will create it for you during project initialization.

```yaml filename=".aiop"
playbook:
  playbook_name: aiop-playbook
  plugins:
    - name: tesla-plugin
      version: "0.2"
  repositories:
    - name: release
      instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
      type: artifactory
      base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/release/
      repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
    - name: qa
      instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
      type: artifactory
      base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/qa/
      repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
  lint_rules:
    - classname: SnakeCaseRule
      path: .aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py
  post_scripts:
    - classname: ApplyPatch
      path: .aiop/rules/apply_patch.py
```

Let's break it down:

<Steps>

```yaml
playbook:
  plugins:
    - name: tesla-plugin
      version: "0.2"
```

The playbook requires the plugin named `tesla-plugin` with version `0.2`. Remember, you can have as many plugins as you want.

```yaml
playbook:
  repositories:
    - name: release
      instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
      type: artifactory
      base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/release/
      repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
    - name: dev
      instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
      type: artifactory
      base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/dev/
      repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
```

There are two remote repositories in this example. The first is `release` and the second is `dev`. In our case, `release` stores production resources, and `dev` stores development resources. It is the same remote repository, hence the same instance. The type is `artifactory` because it is a repository using the Artifactory solution. The base URL is `https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/release/` for the first and `https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/dev/` for the second. The regex extracts information about the team responsible for the resource, its version, and its name.

```yaml
playbook:
  lint_rules:
    - classname: SnakeCaseRule
      path: .aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py
```

The `SnakeCaseRule` rule is defined in the file `.aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py`. In this example, this rule checks that file names are in snake_case.

```yaml
playbook:
  post_scripts:
    - classname: ApplyPatch
      path: .aiop/rules/apply_patch.py
```

The `ApplyPatch` script is defined in the file `.aiop/rules/apply_patch.py`. In this example, this script applies a patch to the generated package.

</Steps>

## Ignoring Files

It is possible to ignore files in the playbook. To do this, create a `.amlignore` file at the root of the playbook. This file follows the same syntax as the `.gitignore` file. For example, to ignore all files with the `.jar` extension:

```plaintext filename=".amlignore"
*.jar
```

Or all files in the `target` directory:
```plaintext filename=".amlignore"
target/
```
