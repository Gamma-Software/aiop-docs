# Playbook Configuration

The playbook needs to be configured to meet your requirements. The configuration file is located in the playbook's relative directory:
- Unix: `<playbook_root>/.aiop/playbook.yaml`
- Windows: `<playbook_root>\.aiop\playbook.yaml`

The playbook must also contain an inventory configuration file that lists the target systems and their characteristics. The inventory configuration file is located in the playbook's relative directory:
- Unix: `<playbook_root>/.aiop/inventory.yaml`
- Windows: `<playbook_root>\.aiop\inventory.yaml` and `<playbook_root>\.aiop\inventory_config.yml`

> `<playbook_root>` is the root directory of the playbook.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Upon Aiop installation, a default configuration file is created. It can be [modified](#personalization) to customize the application's behavior.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Plugins may also provide additional configuration options. Please refer to the plugin documentation for more information. [Contact](mailto:valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com) technical support for any inquiries.
</Callout>

The configuration file is in YAML format. It can be edited using a text editor or a code editor. It will then be read and validated by Aiop to customize the playbook.

## Configuration File Structure

This configuration file is specific to your playbook. It contains information about plugins, remote repositories, custom validation, and post-build scripts, and other customization options that may come from plugins.

```yaml filename=".aiop/playbook.yml"
plugins:
  - name: {plugin_name}
    version: {plugin_version}
repositories:
  - name: {repository_name}
    instance: {instance_name}
    type: {repository_type}
    base_url: {repository_base_url}
    repository_regex: {repository_regex}
lint_rules:
  - classname: {rule_classname}
    path: {relative_script_path}
post_scripts:
  - classname: {rule_classname}
    path: {relative_script_path}
```

## Personalization

To customize, simply open and modify the configuration file.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  In case you don't have any plugins, remote repositories, validation rules, or post-build scripts, you can remove the corresponding sections **but you still must have an empty file**.
</Callout>

### `plugins`

The `plugins` section is a list of plugins to use for the playbook. Each plugin must have a name and a version. You are unlimited in the number of plugins.

### `repositories`

The `repositories` section is a list of remote repositories to use for the playbook. You are not limited in the number of repositories. Each repository must have a name, an instance, a type, a base URL, and a regex. Here's an explanation of each field:

- **`name`:** The repository name. This name is used to identify the repository in declarations.

- **`instance`:** The instance name corresponds to the parameter in the [user configuration file](/docs/configurations/user). It's the instance of a remote repository that the playbook will use.

- **`type`:** The type can currently be `artifactory` or `nexus`.

- **`base_url`** the base URL of the repository. For example, for an Artifactory repository, the base URL is `https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/`.

- **`repository_regex`** is a regular expression to both validate that the path to the remote resource is correct and get additional data to process during generation. For example, you might need to retrieve the resource's version and name and verify that it's a Java application `.jar`. In this case, you can use a regex to extract this information: `(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar`. You can then during package generation retrieve the `version` and `name` values to use in your [`post_scripts`](#lint_rules-and-post_scripts) rule.

### `lint_rules` and `post_scripts`

The `lint_rules` and `post_scripts` sections are lists of rules to execute during package generation. Each rule must specify the class name and the relative path from the project root to the script file.


## Example Configuration

This parameter file can be tricky to set up, which is why we created an inventory template to help you get started. By default, Aiop creates it for you when initializing the project.

```yaml filename=".aiop/playbook.yml"
plugins:
  - name: tesla-plugin
    version: "0.2"
repositories:
  - name: release
    instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.tesla

.com/artifactory/release/
    repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
  - name: qa
    instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/qa/
    repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
lint_rules:
  - classname: SnakeCaseRule
    path: .aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py
post_scripts:
  - classname: ApplyPatch
    path: .aiop/rules/apply_patch.py
```

Let's break it down:

<Steps>

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: tesla-plugin
    version: "0.2"
```

The playbook needs the `tesla-plugin` plugin with version `0.2`. Remember that you can have as many plugins as you like.

  You need the rights to access this plugin. If you don't have it, you can [contact](mailto:valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com) technical support for assistance.
</Callout>

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: release
    instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/release/
    repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
  - name: dev
    instance: artifactory-tesla-repo
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/dev/
    repository_regex: (?<team>((sensors)|(driving)))/(?<version>[0-9.]+)/(?<name>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+).jar
```

There are two remote repositories in this template. The first one is `release`, and the second one is `dev`. In our case, `release` stores production resources, and `dev` stores development resources. It's the same remote repository, which is why the instance is the same. The type is `artifactory` because it's a repository using the Artifactory solution. The base URL is `https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/release/` for the first one and `https://artifactory.tesla.com/artifactory/dev/` for the second one. The regex extracts information about the team responsible for the resource, its version, and its name.

```yaml
lint_rules:
  - classname: SnakeCaseRule
    path: .aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py
```

The `SnakeCaseRule` rule is defined in the `.aiop/rules/snake_case_rule.py` file. For this example, this rule checks that file names are in snake_case.

```yaml
post_scripts:
  - classname: ApplyPatch
    path: .aiop/rules/apply_patch.py
```

The `ApplyPatch` script is defined in the `.aiop/rules/apply_patch.py` file. For this example, this script applies a patch on the generated package.

</Steps>

## Ignoring Files

It's possible to ignore files in the playbook. To do this, simply create a `.amlignore` file at the root of the playbook. This file follows the same syntax as the `.gitignore` file. For example, to ignore all files with the `.jar` extension:

```plaintext filename=".amlignore"
*.jar
```

Or all files in the `target` directory:
```plaintext filename=".amlignore"
target/
```
