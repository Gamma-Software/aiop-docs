# CLI (Command-Line Interface)

Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs) are tools that allow interaction with applications using text-based commands. Aiop offers a CLI for interacting with and executing commands.

## Commands

Commands are instructions that allow interaction with the application. Commands consist of several elements:

- [**init**](/docs/cli/init): The Init command initializes a project.
- [**lint**](/docs/cli/lint): The Lint command performs checks on the project, its declarations, and resources.
- [**build**](/docs/cli/build): The Build command constructs the package.
{/* - [**plugins**](/docs/cli/plugins): The Plugins command manages plugins. */}
