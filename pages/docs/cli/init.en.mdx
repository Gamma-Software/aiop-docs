# `init` Command

The `init` command is used to create a new playbook project to store resources and declarations and generate packages. The new project will be created from a default [project template](https://gitlab.com/leap_tech/playbooks/skeleton). The created project will contain a basic directory structure, configuration files, and examples of resources.

To create a new project, execute the following command:

```bash
aiop init {playbook_path}
```

> `playbook_path` is the path to the directory where you want to create the project.

By running the help command, you can see the available options for the `init` command:

```ansi
usage: aiop init [-h] [--url URL] [-v] [--init_ref] playbook_path

positional arguments:
  playbook_path  Path to create the playbook and git init it.

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --url URL      Url of the remote repository to push the playbook
  --init_ref     Force the git initialization of the playbook(default: False)
  -v, --verbose  Force the verbosity of the logs to DEBUG. Thus overriding the verbosity set in the configuration file.
```

The `--url` option is used to specify the URL of the remote repository where you want to push the project. If you specify this option, the project will be initialized with a git repository and pushed to the remote repository. This can be [Github](https://github.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or any other git repository.

The `--init_ref` option is used to force the initialization of the git repository. By default, the git repository is initialized only if the directory is not already a git repository.
