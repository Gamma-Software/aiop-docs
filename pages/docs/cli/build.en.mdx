# `build` Command

The `build` command is used to construct a package based on the user's system target and properties. There are also options that we will detail.

```bash
aiop build {system_target} {params}
```
> `system_target`: The system target for which to generate the package.

> `params`: The compatibility parameters of the system target. These mandatory parameters will vary depending on the playbook and its configurations as defined by the `.aiop/inventory_config.yml` configuration file in the `compatibility` field ([Learn more](/docs/configurations/inventory)).

When running the help command, here are the available options:

```ansi
usage: aiop build [-h] [--destination_path DESTINATION_PATH] [--force] [--no_caching] [--no_verify]
                  [--retries RETRIES] [--zip_pack] [--goto_pack] [--init_ref] [--upload UPLOAD]
                  system_target

Build a package from a playbook. Be aware that the current positionnal arguments are dynamic and corresponds to
the compatibility arguments defined in the playbook.In order to build a package, you need to be at the root
folder of the playbook.

positional arguments:
  system_target         System target for which to create a package

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --destination_path DESTINATION_PATH
                        Path to destination. By default it will be generated in the root of the playbook_path
                        in the .build folder
  --force               Use destination_path even if it is not empty
  --no_caching          The binaries are copied to the destination folder (not from the cache)
  --no_verify           Do not verify the Artifact integrity. It will not betaken into account if
                        `--no_caching` is not set or the Artifact is not in cache. (default: False, means
                        verifythe artifact integrity)
  --retries RETRIES     Number of retries when downloading an artifact.One retry means that the download was
                        not successful because of an invalid file integrity (checksum).This parameter will
                        override [download_retries] in the user configuration file. - default: 3
  --zip_pack            Zip the built package (default: False)
  --goto_pack           Open in the explorer the newly created package (default: False)
  --upload UPLOAD       Upload the generated installer to a repository (default: ). Requires ' --installer'
                        option
```
