# Build commands

## `build` Command

The `build` command is used to construct a package based on the user's system target and properties. There are also options that we will detail.

```bash
aiop build {system_target} {params}
```
> `system_target`: The system target for which to generate the package.

> `params`: The compatibility parameters of the system target. These mandatory parameters will vary depending on the playbook and its configurations as defined by the `.aiop/inventory_config.yml` configuration file in the `compatibility` field ([Learn more](/docs/configurations/inventory)).

When running the help command, here are the available options:

```ansi
usage: aiop build [-h] --args ARGS [ARGS ...] [--destination_path DESTINATION_PATH] [--force] [--zip_pack] [--goto_pack] [--upload UPLOAD [UPLOAD ...]] [--upload_url UPLOAD_URL]
                  [--upload UPLOAD] [--installer {deb}] [--installer_name INSTALLER_NAME] [--no_verify] [--retries RETRIES] [--no_caching] [-v] [-sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL] [-fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL] [-hp]
                  system_target

Build a package from a playbook. Be aware that the current positionnal arguments are dynamic and corresponds to the compatibility arguments defined in the
playbook.In order to build a package, you need to be at the root folder of the playbook.

positional arguments:
  system_target         System target for which to create a package

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --compat_args ARGS [ARGS ...]
                      List of compatibility arguments.
  --destination_path DESTINATION_PATH
                        Path to destination. By default it will be generated in the root of the playbook_path in the .build folder
  --force               Use destination_path even if it is not empty
  --zip_pack            Zip the built package (default: False)
  --goto_pack           Open in the explorer the newly created package (default: False)
  --upload UPLOAD [UPLOAD ...]
                        Upload the generated installer or zipped package to a repository. Requires `--upload_url` option
  --upload_url UPLOAD_URL
                        Upload repository URL. Requires `--upload` option.
  --installer {deb}     Type of installer to generate
  --installer_name INSTALLER_NAME
  --no_verify           Do not verify the Artifact integrity. It will not betaken into account if `--no_caching` is not set or the Artifact is not in cache.
                        (default: False, means verifythe artifact integrity)
  --retries RETRIES     Number of retries when downloading an artifact.One retry means that the download was not successful because of an invalid file integrity
                        (checksum).This parameter will override [download_retries] in the user configuration file. - default: 3
  --no_caching          The binaries are copied to the destination folder (not from the cache)
  -v, --verbose         Force the verbosity of the logs to DEBUG. Thus overriding the verbosity set in the configuration file.
  -sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL, --stdout_log_level STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the stdoutlog level of the logs.
  -fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL, --file_log_level FILE_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the file_log level of the logs.
  -hp, --hide_progress  Hide the progress bar.
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `destination_path` | Path to the package destination | Root of the playbook path in the `.build` folder |
| `force` | Delete the folder at `destination_path` regardless of its contents | `False`: Does not force creation |
| `no_caching` | Do not use cache to retrieve previously downloaded remote resources | `False`: Remote resources are copied from cache if available |
| `no_verify` | Do not verify the integrity of the remote resource | `False`: Verifies the artifact integrity |
| `installer` | Type of installer to generate. You can create one installer per build | |
| `installer_name` | Name of the installer | |
| `retries` | Number of download retries for an artifact. Overrides the user configuration | 3 |
| `zip_pack` | Zip the generated package | `False`: Does not zip it |
| `goto_pack` | Open file explorer on the generated package | `False`: Does not open it |
| `upload` | Select the package to upload. It could be `zip` or `deb`. It needs the `--upload_url` option to work. | |
| `upload_url` | package upload URL | |
| `verbose` | Forces logging verbosity to `DEBUG` for both console and log files. User settings will not be considered. | `None`: Does not force |
| `stdout_log_level` | Forces logging verbosity in the console to a level. User settings will not be considered. | `None`: Does not force |
| `file_log_level` | Forces logging verbosity in log files to a level. User settings will not be considered. | `None`: Does not force |
| `hide_progress` | Hides the generation progress box. | `None`: Progress is displayed by default |

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you combine the `verbose` option with either `stdout_log_level` or `file_log_level` in the same command, the latter two will not be considered, and the logs will be displayed at a maximum verbosity level.

  - For example, if you use `aiop build --verbose --stdout_log_level INFO`, the logs will be displayed at `DEBUG` level rather than `INFO`.
  - Another example, if you want to disable console logs for this build but still use the `--verbose` option: `aiop build --verbose --stdout_log_level DISABLED`, the logs will still be displayed at `DEBUG` level.
</Callout>

## `build_all` Command

The `build_all` commands is used to construct all the packages from the playbook. The command has the following options:

```bash
aiop build_all [--threads THREADS]
```

It will read the `packages.yml` file from the playbook configuration folder `.aiop` and build all the packages defined in the file. Please refer to the [documentation](/docs/configurations/packages) to learn how to configure the `packages.yml` file.

The packages will be generated in parallel using threads to speed up the process. The number of threads can be set using the `--threads` option. After the build process, a list of successful and failed packages will be displayed.


<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The `build_all` command will disable the logs in the terminal by default to avoid cluttering the console. The logs in the the log files will still be generated.
</Callout>

When running the help command, here are the available options:

```ansi
usage: aiop build_all [-h] [--threads THREADS]

Build all the package from the playbook. You need first to have parametrizedthe .aiop/packages.yml. See the documentation https://aiop.io/docs/build_all to know how
to do it.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                        Number of threads. Determines the number of parallel package build. Default is 4.
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `threads` | Number of threads to use for parallel package building | 4 |


### CI-CD

When the command `aiop build_all` is invoked in the CI-CD pipeline, a new dynamic pipeline will be created.

## Commande `build_again`

It's possible to run last command with `aiop build_again`.

```ansi
usage: aiop build_again [-h]

Rebuilds with the last build command.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

AIOP will take the last command of `aiop build` arguments and replay it again.
