  The linter is a tool that checks your code for errors and warnings. It is a static analysis tool used to identify problematic patterns present in Python code.

# Linting Command

The linting command allows you to run verification scripts on the playbook, its parameters, its declarations, and its resources. Optionally, it is possible to check the target system and compatible resources. Additionally, custom verification scripts included in the playbook can be executed.

## `lint` Command

To run the `lint` command, the user must navigate to the playbook directory.
This command checks the playbook, its parameters, and the syntax of its declarations, as well as the existence of its resources.

```bash
aiop lint
```

Running the help command displays the available options:

```ansi
usage: aiop lint [-h] [-v] [-sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL] [-fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL] [-hp]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Force the verbosity of the logs to DEBUG. Thus overriding the verbosity set in the configuration file.
  -sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL, --stdout_log_level STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the stdoutlog level of the logs.
  -fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL, --file_log_level FILE_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the file_log level of the logs.
  -hp, --hide_progress  Hide the progress bar.
```

## `lint_target` Command

To run the `lint_target` command, the user must navigate to the playbook directory.
The `lint_target` command verifies the playbook, its parameters, the syntax of its declarations, and the existence of its resources, as well as their compatibility with the target system.

```bash
aiop lint_target {system_target} {params}
```
> `system_target`: The target system for which to validate the playbook

> `params`: The compatibility parameters for the target system. This mandatory parameter will vary depending on the playbook and its configurations as it is defined by the `.aiop/inventory_config.yml` configuration file in the `compatibility` field ([Learn more](/docs/configurations/inventory)).

Running the help command displays the available options:

```ansi
usage: aiop lint_target [-h] --compat_args ARGS [ARGS ...] [--no_verify] [--retries RETRIES] [--no_caching] [-v] [-sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL]
                        [-fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL] [-hp]
                        system_target

positional arguments:
  system_target         System target for which to create a package

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --compat_args ARGS [ARGS ...]
                      List of compatibility arguments for the target system
  --no_verify           Do not verify the Artifact integrity. It will not betaken into account if `--no_caching` is not set or the Artifact is not in cache.
                        (default: False, means verifythe artifact integrity)
  --retries RETRIES     Number of retries when downloading an artifact.One retry means that the download was not successful because of an invalid file integrity
                        (checksum).This parameter will override [download_retries] in the user configuration file. - default: 3
  --no_caching          The binaries are copied to the destination folder (not from the cache)
  -v, --verbose         Force the verbosity of the logs to DEBUG. Thus overriding the verbosity set in the configuration file.
  -sll STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL, --stdout_log_level STDOUT_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the stdoutlog level of the logs.
  -fll FILE_LOG_LEVEL, --file_log_level FILE_LOG_LEVEL
                        Sets and overrides the file_log level of the logs.
  -hp, --hide_progress  Hide the progress bar.
