# Uninstallation

Uninstallation is straightforward. AIOP provides an uninstallation tool that assists you in removing AIOP from your machine.

```bash
aiop_uninstall
```

It offers to remove the configuration files and the application. If you choose to remove the configuration files, they will be lost. However, if you do not remove them, upon the next reinstall, AIOP will use the old configurations.

## Manual Uninstallation

If you opted to uninstall AIOP without removing the configuration files, you can delete them manually:
