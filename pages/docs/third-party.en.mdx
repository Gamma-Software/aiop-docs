# Vocabulary

Aiop uses specific vocabulary to describe these concepts.

## Aiop

`All-In-One-Packager` generates uniform packages for different platforms using a simple source declaration. "Packages as Code". [Learn more](../aiop/)

## Leaptech

Leaptech is the name of the company that develops Aiop.

## Aiop core

This is the core of Aiop. It contains the basic functionalities for resource management. It is responsible for selecting resources based on the user's target.

## Aiop CLI

Aiop is accessible via a Command Line Interface (CLI). [Learn more](../cli/)

## Aiop lib

A [playbook](#playbook) is extendable via custom Python scripts. These scripts must include dependencies on the Aiop library.

## Aiop plugin

Aiop is extendable via plugins. A plugin is an extension that adds features to Aiop. [Learn more](../plugin/)

## Artifact Registries

Artifact registries are systems for storing binary files. They are used to store the [artifacts](#artifact) generated by Aiop. [Learn more](../registry/)

## Artifact

Artifacts are elements that represent physical entities in a software system. Artifacts represent physical units of implementation, such as executable files, libraries, software components (binaries or configuration files), documents, and document bases.

## Target (System)

A target is a combination of parameters for which you want to generate a package. It is the [playbook](#playbook) that describes the parameter combination for a given target. [Learn more](../system/)

## Linting

Linting is a process that involves analyzing declarations to find errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. We distinguish between two different processes:

- **Static Linting:** The most classic, it checks the syntax of declaration files.
- **Dynamic Linting:** It checks the consistency of declarations based on the resources available on the system.

## AML

> Aiop Markup Language

This is the resource declaration file. This file is based on the YAML markup language. [Learn more](../declarations/)

## Declaration

A declaration corresponds to a resource described in a [.aml](#aml) file. [Learn more](../declaration/)

## Inventory

An inventory is a list of targets. For each target, packages can be generated. [Learn more](../inventory/)

## Package As Code (PAC)

Package as code is a method of package management that involves describing packages using a human-readable text file.

## Playbook

The core of your project that contains all the resources (texts, configurations, binaries...) as well as Aiop declarative files called [`.aml`](#aml). [Learn more](../playbook/)

## AML

`Aiop Markup Language` is a resource description language. It is used to describe the resources of your project. It is based on the YAML format. [Learn more](../aml/)

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created in 2004 by John Gruber with the help of Aaron Swartz. Its purpose is to provide a syntax that is easy to read and write. [Learn more](../markdown/)

## Git

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes made to code, collaborate on the same project as a team, and easily merge contributions. Its advantages include efficient version management, branching to isolate features, fast performance even on large repositories, decentralized distribution for offline work, flexibility in workflows, and a robust ecosystem with services like GitHub and GitLab. In summary, Git improves collaboration, management, and tracking of software development projects. [Learn more](https://git-scm.com)
