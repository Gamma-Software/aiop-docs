# Executable Resources

An executable resource is a file that can be executed. It can be a file with an `.exe`, `.sh`, `.bat`, etc. extension. You can find a list of executable file extensions [here](https://aerorock.co.nz/list-of-executable-file-extensions-windows/).

## Declaration

In case you have resources that are executables, you can declare them in the `.aml` file so that they are copied into the package with their associated execution mode. Simply add the `executable` field as `True`. Let's take the following example, we have a folder `resources` containing three files `app1.py`, `app2.sh`, and `app3`, and the declaration file `.aml`. We want these files to be copied into the package with their associated execution mode.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".git">
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".aiop">
        <FileTree.File name="inventory_config.yml" />
        <FileTree.File name="inventory.yml" />
        <FileTree.File name="playbook.yml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".aml" />
        <FileTree.File name="app1.py" />
        <FileTree.File name="app2.sh" />
        <FileTree.File name="app3" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```yaml {3, 8, 13} filename="resources/.aml" /True/
- source: app1.py
  destination: app1.py
  executable: True
  compatibility:
    - ...
- source: app2.sh
  destination: app2.sh
  executable: True
  compatibility:
    - ...
- source: app3
  destination: app1
  executable: True
  compatibility:
    - ...
```

By default, this field is set to `False`. If you do not declare it, the file will be copied into the package but will not be executable.
