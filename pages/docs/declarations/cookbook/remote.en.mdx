# Remote Resource

AIOP allows retrieving resources remotely from different artifact repositories (or repositories). This is a very useful feature for fetching resources from a variety of remote servers. Currently, the following repositories are supported:

- [Artifactory](#artifactory)
- [Nexus](#nexus)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
There are still other repositories to support. If you have a specific need, feel free to contact us.
</Callout>

You can retrieve any type of resource.

## Configuration Requirements

Access to remote servers and especially AIOP configuration must be set up. For more information, please refer to the [User Configuration](/docs/configurations/user#structure-du-fichier-de-configuration) and [Playbook](/docs/configurations/playbook) sections.

### Playbook Configuration

Let's take the example of the playbook configuration file below. Let's focus on the first two items in the `repositories` list:

```yaml {3-12} filename="~/.aiop/config.yaml"
...
repositories:
  - name: artifactory-release
    instance: artifactory-company
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/release/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
  - name: artifactory-develop
    instance: artifactory-company
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/develop/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
  - name: nexus-develop
    instance: nexus-company
    type: nexus
    base_url: https://nexus.my-company.com/repo/develop/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
...
```

We have set up an artifact registry instance called `artifactory-company` with two repositories `artifactory-release` and `artifactory-develop`. These repositories have different base URLs as they do not point to the same artifact repository. They also have different regular expressions to filter the resources to retrieve.

Let's dissect the regular expression of the first repository `^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)\/(?P<filename>.+)$`. As a reminder, the naming of groups allows you to retrieve the values and use them during package generation:
- `(?P<app_name>.+)` : application name (any name without character limit and constraints)
- `(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)` : application version (2 integer numbers with a dot as separator)
- `(?P<filename>.+)` : file name (any name without character limit and constraints)

You'll notice that the second repository `artifactory-develop` has a different regular expression `^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$`. This allows retrieving resources with a development version, hence the `-dev` added in the application version `(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)`.

```yaml {13-17} filename="~/.aiop/config.yaml"
...
repositories:
  - name: artifactory-release
    instance: artifactory-company
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/release/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
  - name: artifactory-develop
    instance: artifactory-company
    type: artifactory
    base_url: https://artifactory.my-company.com/artifactory/develop/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
  - name: nexus-develop
    instance: nexus-company
    type: nexus
    base_url: https://nexus.my-company.com/repo/develop/
    repository_regex: ^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$
...
```

Then, we have set up another artifact registry instance called `nexus-company` with a repository `nexus-develop`. For clarity in the explanation, we chose to use the same regular expression as the one used for the second repository `artifactory-develop`.

### User Configuration

Next, let's look at the user configuration for authentication on the remote `artifactory` server.

```yaml {3-6} filename="~/.aiop/config.yaml"
...
repositories:
  - instance: artifactory-company
    username: admin
    password: KhH479X66hH98i
    auth_type: basic
...
```

You'll notice that the instance `artifactory-company` corresponds to the one configured in the playbook. Here, the user decides to authenticate with a username `admin` and a password `KhH479X66hH98i` using the `basic` authentication type. (See the [User Configuration](/docs/configurations/user#personalisation) section for more information)

## Artifactory

The configurations have been defined previously. We are now able to retrieve resources from the remote `Artifactory` server. Here's a concrete example of retrieving a parameter file from the `artifactory-release` repository:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".git">
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".aiop" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="ressources" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".aml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You'll notice that there are no local resources in the `ressources` folder as everything is remote on the server.
</Callout>

```yaml {1, 6} filename="ressources/.aml" /<artifactory-release>/ /<artifactory-develop>/
- source: <artifactory-release>my-app/1.0/fichier
  destination: fichier
  compatibility:
    - apps: [my-app]
      envs: [prod]
- source: <artifactory-develop>my-app/1.0-dev/fichier
  destination: fichier
  compatibility:
    - apps: [my-app]
      envs: [dev]
```

In the first declaration, the `fichier` file will be retrieved from the `artifactory-release` repository of the `artifactory-company` instance with the application name `my-app` and version `1.0` and placed in the package at its root with the name `fichier`. The file will be retrieved from the remote repository verified by the regular expression `^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)\/(?P<filename>.+)$` and also verified by its hash to ensure its integrity and security.

In the second declaration, the `bin` file will be retrieved from the `artifactory-release` repository of the `artifactory-company` instance with the application name `my-app` and version `1.0` and placed in the package at its root with the name `fichier`. The file will be retrieved from the remote repository verified by the regular expression `^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+-dev)\/(?P<filename>.+)$` and also verified by its hash to ensure its integrity and security.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You'll notice that the binary in the second declaration will be retrieved only when the desired package is intended for the **development** environment. This is possible due to the declared compatibility in the second declaration. And the source does not come from the same repository as the first declaration.
</Callout>

## Nexus

The configurations have been set up earlier, and now we can retrieve resources from the remote `artifactory` server. Here's a concrete example to retrieve a parameter file from the `artifactory-release` repository:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".git">
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".aiop" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="ressources" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".aml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```yaml {1} filename="ressources/.aml" /<nexus-develop>/
- source: <nexus-develop>my-app-from-nexus/1.0-dev/fichier
  destination: fichier
  compatibility:
    - ...
```

In this case, the `fichier` file will be retrieved from the `nexus-develop` repository of the `nexus-company` instance with the application name `my-app-from-nexus` and version `1.0-dev` and placed in the package at its root with the name `app`. The file will be retrieved from the remote repository verified by the regular expression `^(?P<app_name>.+)\/(?P<version>\d+\.\d+)\/(?P<filename>.+)$` and also verified by its hash to ensure its integrity and security.

## Caching and Verification

Please note that remote resources are stored in the local cache to avoid retrieving them on every package generation ([Learn more about caching](/docs/caching)). However, they are verified on each package generation to ensure that the resource is up to date compared to the latest version available on the remote server ([Learn more about verification](/docs/cli/build)).
