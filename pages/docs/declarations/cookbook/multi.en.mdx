# Multiple Compatibility

You can declare resources with different compatibilities for target systems.

## Declaration

To declare multiple compatibilities, you simply add a new entry in the `compatibility` array for each target system. For example, if you have a file that needs to be copied into packages for target systems `os/linux` and `os/windows`, and the compatible app differs between these two systems, you can declare it as follows:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="playbook" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".git">
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".aiop">
        <FileTree.File name="inventory_config.yml" />
        <FileTree.File name="inventory.yml" />
        <FileTree.File name="playbook.yml" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="resources" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".aml" />
        <FileTree.File name="file.txt" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

```yaml showLineNumbers {4-7} filename="resources/.aml"
- source: file.txt
  destination: file.txt
  compatibility:
    - os/linux:
        app: [applinux]
    - os/windows:
        app: [appwin]
```

This avoids having to declare the resource twice, once for each target system.

```yaml showLineNumbers {4-5, 10-11} filename="resources/.aml"
- source: file.txt
  destination: file.txt
  compatibility:
    - os/linux:
        app: [applinux]

- source: file.txt
  destination: file.txt
  compatibility:
    - os/windows:
        app: [appwin]
```
