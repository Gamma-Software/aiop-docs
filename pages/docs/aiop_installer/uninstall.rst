Uninstall
=========

The uninstallation is really simple. Just run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip uninstall aiop

Post-uninstall
--------------

After uninstalling the package, you should remove the following files manually:

.. code-block:: shell

   rm ~/.aioprc

.. note::
   For now the post-installation is done manually. In the future, it will be
   done automatically.
