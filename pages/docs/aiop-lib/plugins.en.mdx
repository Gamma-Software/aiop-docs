# Plugins

Plugins are extensions that enable adding new functionalities to Aiop. They are used to add new commands, configurations, declaration possibilities, and specific tasks (outside of the `lint` and `post-build` steps) for a user and/or company. For example, a plugin could be used to add the ability to read, understand, and manipulate proprietary files for companies.

## How It Works

Plugins are automatically downloaded upon starting Aiop. They are then loaded into memory and used to extend Aiop's functionalities. Each user with the rights to use the plugin can utilize them for package generation.

## Configurations

To use a plugin, the playbook must declare the plugin and its version in the `plugins` section of the `aiop.yml` file.

```yaml filename="<playbook_root>/.aiop/playbook.yml"
plugins:
  - name: my-plugin
    version: 1.0
```

> `my-plugin` is the plugin name, and `1.0` is the plugin version.

To create packages from the playbook that includes this plugin, the user must have access rights to the plugin. In other words, they must have a license and an Aiop account associated with this plugin (Contact [support](mailto:valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com) for this):

```yaml {2-6} filename="~/.aiop/aiop.yml"
...
license:
  key: "license key" # The license key is provided by the administrator and associated with a plugin
  username: "username"
  password: "password"
  api_token: "api token"
...
```

The user must also declare the plugin configurations in the `plugin_config` section of the `aiop.yml` file.

```yaml {3} filename="~/.aiop/aiop.yml"
...
plugin_config:
  param_config: value
...
```

`param_config` is the name of the plugin-specific configuration. Refer to the plugin documentation for available configurations. Contact [support](mailto:valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com) for assistance.

## How to Create a Plugin?

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Currently, we do not offer a self-service plugin creation system. To create a plugin for Aiop, you need to contact [support](mailto:valentin.rudloff.perso@gmail.com).
</Callout>

Once the plugin is created, we will associate it with your licenses. Aiop will automatically download the plugin upon its startup.
